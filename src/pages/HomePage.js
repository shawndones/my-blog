        <p>When I’m done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. I hope they remember you.</p>
        <p>I know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.</p>
        <p>Going to bed hungry. Scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what’s happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It’s a paradise.</p>
